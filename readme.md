# PodmanStatusBar

A lightweight macOS status bar application to monitor and manage Podman VMs and containers. 

## Why PodmanStatusBar? 

I created this app because I often forgot to shut down my Podman VM and also running containers.  The official Podman Desktop app is too bloated, and its top bar icon provides no useful information at a glance.  PodmanStatusBar solves this by providing a minimal, lightweight alternative that keeps you informed about your Podman VM status and the list of running containers directly from your menu bar and a place where you can start and stop the VM.
